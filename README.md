Side-by-side build of this tutorial: https://realpython.com/python-django-blog/#demo-a-django-blog-admin-a-graphql-api-and-a-vue-front-end

## How to Use

### Starting the back-end Django application

In a new terminal tab:

1. Install the back-end requirements in the environment of your choice:
  ```shell
  $ cd backend/
  $ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
1. Create the initial Django database by running migrations:
  ```shell
  $ python manage.py migrate
  ```
1. Create a Django superuser:
  ```shell
  $ python manage.py createsuperuser
  ```
1. Run the Django project (by default on port 8000):
  ```shell
  $ python manage.py runserver
  ```

### Starting the front-end Vue application

In a new terminal tab:

  ```shell
  $ cd frontend/
  $ npm install
  ```

  ```shell
  $ npm run serve
  ```

### Add a few posts
